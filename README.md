# IPCV
A repository to post some exercises I did in my university's Image Processing and Computer Vision course.

In this repository there are:

- Smoothing filters applying and edge detection;
- Code and pdf documents of a face recognition algorithm applied in a 30 second video.

All code made in this repository used the OpenCV library for python.
